This theme contains files from CustomCSSforFx which can be found at https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx
The included icons versions of the same icons from Firefox but with a shadow filter.

Both results_into_urlbar.uc.js and bindings/urlbar.xml allow the autocomplete popup to be the same width as the urlbar, compatibility was only tested with Firefox 65.

new_tab_command.uc.js forces new tabs to open at the end when middle clicking the new tab button, left clicking is disabled by some rules in userChrome.css.
